# Version / revision information for EUV:
# - v## refers to the file version, which changes if CDF fields are modified.
#    As of 6/17/23, it is locked at v15.
# - r## refers to the version of data available for that version.
# want the newest version & revision.

    This routine is based on the EUV SIS document and the MAVEN SPEDAS
    routine 'mvn_euv_l3_load.pro'. We thank and credit the authors of both.

    L2 data consists of solar irradiances in three bandpasses calibrated
    for background signal, out-of-band signal, normalized gain, etc.
    Uncertainties for each irradiance also provided, with a flag indicating if
    EUV has favorable pointing. Also includes corrected count rates pre-
    conversion to irradiance units.

    L3 data from EUV consists of outputs of the FISM-M model based on
    EUV calibrated band irradiance. This includes an averaged spectra
    (day or minute) as a function of time, a quality flag,
    and the Mars-sun distance at time of observation.

    flag: integer representing data useability
         (0 - good, 1 - occultation, 2 - no pointing, 3 - sun partial in FOV,
          4 - sun not in FOV, 5 - windowed,  6 - eclipse, 7 - spare), (n_time)
